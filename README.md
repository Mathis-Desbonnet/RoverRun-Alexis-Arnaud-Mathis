# RoverRun
### By Arnaud Chadal, Alexis Demont and Mathis Desbonnet

---------------------
Welcome your new little Rover.

He is currently lost onto Mars and really need to go back to the base!

You can just upload one program, and, surprise, we made it for you.

RoverRun is a program in C that will try to find the best way to go to the base using trees and stack.

The program use a graphic libraries made for C called SDL. To install correctly and run the program, please visit [README-Set_up.md](README-Set_up.md).

All the info that you need (like the way choose, the next movement...) is print in the console.

The program will try is best, however, there can be some road that contain hard rocks, hill or dune that may modify the rover path....... Eventually, that can lead to his death.......

### Have Fun!
